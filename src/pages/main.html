        I get so nervous that i look like a spaz most of the time. I do things and then
        think is what i'm doing right now hurting my chances of love or survival, or happiness?
        Love is a wild ride. It leaves no survivors.

    <p>
        This is the first option of seperating a paragraph. In this option I am not going to do anything
        other than type a bunch of nonesense in to this paragraph tag and then 
        randomly at some point i'm going to skip a line and indent and see what happens.

            Ok here we go getting crazy with that paragraph
    </p>
<h3>
    This is the option omiting the p tag, this is the sloppy version of seperating paragraphs.
    this is header 3
        header 3 is probably the most appealing size.  Today was so much fun
    today I went to Devil's hole with Leo, Joel, Russel, Kay, Hong Yang and
    Emmauel.  I like that they let me be "the" girl in the group.
     <br>  
     <br>
        It's not always easy being their sole female, but i think i've done quite well.
    Today, i got a compliment from Joel too. He does not think that i have drank the cool aid. :)

        This 
                            is
                    my 
        expression of :
                survival and fitness
        in a world far different than anything I have known.
        Some days I think I know so much. I think I can see the 
        world and every in it as they are. Like I am some sort of
        myseriously perfect person.  But, I am not perfect. Won't ever be.
        Alas, Survive!
        Survive and be loved and you will live a good life.
        Be healthy and fit and you will be loved,
        Be adundant in family and career and you will be loved,
        You will see love in your home, family, job, friends and community,
        because you have created it. From all of the imperfect.
        Survive.  It's the best choice.

<h3>
    <p> MY LISTS!! </p>
    <pre> My Unordered LIST
        this list is a random crap that i like to look at.  
        This is stuff that when i see it my eyes just get happy.
        The purpose of this list is to learn that using this -ul 
        tag and -li tags inside of that allows me to make unordered lists.
    </pre> 
    <ul>
        <li> Butterflies </li>
        <li> Sassy's paws</li>
        <li> June's nose</li>
        <li> Sunflowers </li>
        <li> My window succulents</li>
        <li>puppies, all puppies</li>
        <li>turtles, they are rare and possible extinct</li>
    </ul>

    <pre> My Ordered List 
        And then in this list i am going to put my
         opinions of how things would go on 
         a perfect day in my world if it was 
         just a good regular work day
    </pre>
    <ol>
        <!-- if I want to add a bit of variation in when making lists you can add the attribute, type= , it will look like: 
        <ol type ="A">  remember that it is telling you that the ordered list is going to be in Capital A, B, C etc. You can
            do: A, a, 1, I, i; and if you want to nest an ordered list into an unordered list you simply break the <li></li> open and 
            then nest that sucker right on in there:

        <li> Sassy snuggles 
            <ol> snuggle options>
                <li> the cute muffins thing<li>
                <li> when she snuggled into my arm pit</li>
                <li> when she is extra sweet and puts her purry happy face on mine</li>

        </li>
        <li> Walk/ run for 20 mins: Goal 2 miles every morning</li>
        <li> Stretch</li>
        
        Bingo! You did lists!
        -->
        <li> Sassy snuggles </li>
        <li> Walk/ run for 20 mins: Goal 2 miles every morning</li>
        <li> Stretch</li>
        <li> Water </li>
        <li> Breakfast:probably somethink kefir, berries and granola or oatmeal, berries & nuts</li>
        <li> Tea and vitamins (including that super greens drink) </li> 
        <li> Login for emails and updates at 8am </li>
